                <img class="photo" src="./assets/images/MUGSHOT.jpg" alt="bioPhoto">
                <p>Derek Johnson is the founder of Whirlybug
                    Productions, a B2B company which provides
                    drone solutions to real estate management
                    companies. In turn, realtors can showcase their
                    properties and better market their listings to
                    buyers while offering sellers a cutting-edge
                    presentation of their property.
                    Prior to founding Whirlybug Productions, Johnson
                    worked as a specialized Internet Sales Manager at
                    Coggin Automotive Group, one of the largest automobile retailers in the United States
                    with an annual overturn of some 180,000 retail vehicles and revenues of $6.5 billion.
                    Here, he oversaw a team which offered both new and used cars from popular auto
                    brands including Chevrolet, Buick, Toyota, and other domestic and foreign marques,
                    successfully closing deals with clients.
                    Johnson is also an expert PC technician and has worked several positions in the PC
                    Repair industry including Manager of Command Computers, where he helped clients
                    to fix hardware issues with their PCs. Prior to this, he worked as a Technical Installer
                    at Groupware International – GI Broadband, providing both residential and
                    commercial clients with the telecommunications they required successfully through
                    expert cable installation and network integration services.
                    Johnson is also a helicopter pilot who has attended flight school and recently became
                    a father to a young boy. His passion for technology began when he was a young
                    boy, tinkering with his parents’ computer files to make programs run despite the
                    limited RAM (Random Access Memory) that it had – from this grew his fascination for
                    the hardware behind the software, and a natural entry into careers where this passion
                    was rewarded.
                    Currently, Johnson is attending Georgia Tech Professional Education’s Coding Boot
                    Camp to hone his skills as a web development professional and further enhance the
                    portfolio of value he can offer to his clients in drone technology, web development,
                    and sales skills.
